SwarmAI is a general name for projects I do that use AI for swarming.
The images below are from a project where nerual trees are used to generate intelligent paths with very low computational effort.
These UAVs are playing the Target/Avoid/Reach game, however this technology is applicable to any purpose where a training set can be generated.
