Volcano Drone's mission is to autonomously sample volcanic fumaroles and return pristine gas samples.  Volcanoes represent one of the harshest enviroments on the planets - steep terrain, high temperatures and noxious gases - making them the perfect candidate for automous exploration.  Below are some images taken from a field trip to the fumaroles of Mammoth Valley.
