A collection of hardware designs (mostly PCBs) I've made over the years.
Quality varies between them, however they should all make for a good starting point for anyone looking to improve upon my work.

PCBs
- [KiCAD Libraries](https://github.com/AndersonRayner/kicad-libraries)
- [Pololu Regulator Breakouts](https://github.com/AndersonRayner/pcb_pololu_breakouts)
- [SimpleRTK2Blite Logger Board](https://github.com/AndersonRayner/simpleRTK2Blite_logger)
- [UAV PCB Breakout Boards](https://github.com/AndersonRayner/pcb_uav_breakouts)
- [Aurelia X6 Custom Distribution Boards](https://github.com/AndersonRayner/pcb_aurelia)
- [ROS1 Hardware Sync Node (RP2040)](https://github.com/AndersonRayner/ros_sync_node_hw)
- [Teensy 4.0 Breakout Board](https://github.com/AndersonRayner/teensy_4.0_breakout)
