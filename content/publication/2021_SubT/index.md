abstract: "This paper presents and discusses algorithms, hardware, and software architecture developed by the TEAM CoSTAR (Collaborative SubTerranean Autonomous Robots), competing in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge.  Specifically, it presents the techniques utilized within the Tunnel (2019) and Urban (2020) competitions,  where CoSTAR achieved 2nd and 1st place, respectively. We also discuss CoSTARâ€™s demonstrations in Martian-analog surface and subsurface (lava tubes) exploration. The paper introduces our autonomy solution, referred to as NeBula (Networked Belief-aware Perceptual Autonomy).  NeBula is an uncertainty-aware framework that aims at enabling resilient and modular autonomy solutions by performing reasoning and decision making in the belief space (space of probability distributions over the  robot  and  world  states).   We  discuss  various  components  of  the  NeBula  framework, including:  (i) geometric and semantic environment mapping; (ii) a multi-modal positioning system;  (iii)  traversability  analysis  and  local  planning;  (iv)  global  motion  planning  and exploration  behavior;  (i)  risk-aware  mission  planning;  (vi)  networking  and  decentralized reasoning; and (vii) learning-enabled adaptation.  We discuss the performance of NeBula on several robot types (e.g.  wheeled, legged, flying), in various environments.  We discuss the specific results and lessons learned from fielding this solution in the challenging courses of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge competition."
