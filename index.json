Our algorithm adapts the centralized, perfect information, discrete-action space method from Alpha Zero to a decentralized, partial information, continuous action space setting for multi-robot applications. Our method has three interacting components:(i) a centralized, perfect-information ''expert'' Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with large computation resources that provides expert demonstrations, (ii) a decentralized, partial-information ''learner'' MCTS with small computation resources that runs in real-time and provides self-play examples, and (iii) policy \u0026 value neural networks that are trained with the expert demonstrations and bias both the expert and the learner tree growth. Our numerical experiments demonstrate neural expansion generates compact search trees with better solution quality and 20 times less computational expense compared to MCTS without neural expansion. The resulting policies are dynamically sophisticated, demonstrate coordination between robots, and play the Reach-Target-Avoid differential game significantly better than the state-of-the-art control-theoretic base-line for multi-robot, double-integrator systems.

This paper presents the design of a novel, fully-electric VTOL aircraft designed to satisfy a medical transport mission by carrying a patient and a paramedic a moderate distance. The paper also presents a scale vehicle model that can be used to test the vehicle design and potential autonomy technologies as well as the special design considerations unique to a VTOL with ﬁxed-wing capabilities.

Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can help reduce the risks and difficulties of measuring and sampling these gases, enabling studies of volcanic systems that were otherwise inaccessible. This paper presents the first known effort to design, develop and field test a UAV-borne Gas Capture System (UGCS) for volcanic fumarole sampling. This work includes the development of a sampling probe deployment mechanism, sample canister selection, payload-to-UAV interfacing, and a light-weight visual/thermal camera package.

Tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used to optimise the shape of UAV frames by giving a detailed understanding of how the flow interacts with the vehicle. The effects of the frame on the propellers (and vice versa) can be a dominant flow feature, especially for multirotors, however fully modelling propellers in CFD is a very involved task requiring intensive computational power.\nActuator and blade element disks provide a simple way of modelling the effects of a propeller in CFD by artificially applying a force into the domain, emulating the time-averaged effect of the propeller to reduce the computational requirements.\nThis paper presents an actuator disk model with three different loading profiles and a blade element disk model with two methods of calculating the thrust and the torque of the propeller.

The effect of using the differing models is shown, with results matching well with other implementations presented in literature.","tags":[],"title":"Modelling Propellers in FINE/Open using OpenLabs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Anderson","Kai Lehmkuehler","Derrick Ho","KC Wong","Patrick Hendrick"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1379376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1379376e3,"objectID":"fbfae3de84997e79390e3d36e83d0697","permalink":"https://andersonrayner.github.io/publication/2013_annularwingdesign/","publishdate":"2013-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013_annularwingdesign/","section":"publication","summary":"Most research today into the aerodynamics of ducts seeks to increase the thrust or efficiency of a propeller nested inside. This study takes a diﬀerent approach to duct design and instead examines the use of a duct as an annular wing with the primary function of generating lift for high speed, cruising flight. The variables of investigation for this research are the location of the propeller inside the annular wing and how the thrust generated by the propeller effects the performance of the wing at various angles of attack. This investigation utilises wind tunnel testing to measure the forces generated by the wing and computational fluid dynamics to study the nature of the flow. The results show little difference aerodynamically between fore and aft mounting locations for the propeller in non-stalled flight, however, a forward mounted propeller is shown to be preferable when the flight envelope also includes the stalled regime. In hover, the aft propeller is shown to be favourable.","tags":[],"title":"Propeller Location Optimisation for Annular Wing Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://andersonrayner.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
