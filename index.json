Due to this ease of entry, flight testing with UAVs is becoming increasingly commonplace as the technology allows cutting-edge research to leave the realm of simulation and enter real-world trials in very short time frames without the restrictions and costs of piloted, full-scale flight.  Where traditional flight test engineers required many years of specialized training, budding UAV flight test engineers often start with little-to-no prior personal or in-house experience, and go through the same trail-and-error processes as those before them.  This paper aims to document many years of experience flight testing at a university level, both to provide a basic understanding of the process for anyone getting started, and to share ideas with more experienced operators.  It covers aspects such as instrumentation, flight controllers, airframes, bridging the sim-to-real gap and methodologies for conducting safe and efficient flight test campaigns.","tags":[],"title":"UAS Flight Testing in Support of Research for Academia: Lessons and Experiences from the Field","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Agha","Kyohei Otsu","Benjamin Morrell","and more"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"a034f5fa42f55724517e37d03077ef20","permalink":"https://andersonrayner.github.io/publication/2022_subt/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_subt/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents and discusses algorithms, hardware, and software architecture developed by the TEAM CoSTAR (Collaborative SubTerranean Autonomous Robots), competing in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge.

We also discuss CoSTAR’s demonstrations in Martian-analog surface and subsurface (lava tubes) exploration. The paper introduces our autonomy solution, referred to as NeBula (Networked Belief-aware Perceptual Autonomy).  NeBula is an uncertainty-aware framework that aims at enabling resilient and modular autonomy solutions by performing reasoning and decision making in the belief space (space of probability distributions over the  robot  and  world  states).   We  discuss  various  components  of  the  NeBula  framework, including:  (i) geometric and semantic environment mapping; (ii) a multi-modal positioning system;  (iii)  traversability  analysis  and  local  planning;  (iv)  global  motion  planning  and exploration  behavior;  (i)  risk-aware  mission  planning;  (vi)  networking  and  decentralized reasoning; and (vii) learning-enabled adaptation.  We discuss the performance of NeBula on several robot types (e.g.  wheeled, legged, flying), in various environments.

Our algorithm adapts the centralized, perfect information, discrete-action space method from Alpha Zero to a decentralized, partial information, continuous action space setting for multi-robot applications. Our method has three interacting components:(i) a centralized, perfect-information ''expert'' Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with large computation resources that provides expert demonstrations, (ii) a decentralized, partial-information ''learner'' MCTS with small computation resources that runs in real-time and provides self-play examples, and (iii) policy \u0026 value neural networks that are trained with the expert demonstrations and bias both the expert and the learner tree growth. Our numerical experiments demonstrate neural expansion generates compact search trees with better solution quality and 20 times less computational expense compared to MCTS without neural expansion. The resulting policies are dynamically sophisticated, demonstrate coordination between robots, and play the Reach-Target-Avoid differential game significantly better than the state-of-the-art control-theoretic base-line for multi-robot, double-integrator systems. Our hardware experiments on an aerial swarm demonstrate the computational advantage of neural tree expansion, enabling online  planning at 20 Hz with effective policies in complex scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Neural Tree Expansion for Multi-Robot Planning in Non-Cooperative Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["UAS"],"content":"The Autonomous Flying Ambulance is designed as a next-generation flight test platform for autonomy research.

Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can help reduce the risks and difficulties of measuring and sampling these gases, enabling studies of volcanic systems that were otherwise inaccessible. This paper presents the first known effort to design, develop and field test a UAV-borne Gas Capture System (UGCS) for volcanic fumarole sampling. This work includes the development of a sampling probe deployment mechanism, sample canister selection, payload-to-UAV interfacing, and a light-weight visual/thermal camera package.

Flight testing with an instrumented test aircraft allowed the determination of the optimum launch attitude and the general operating procedures, including a fast and safe method for the sky-crane to rapidly descent from altitude after the launch.","tags":[],"title":"Flight Experimentation Towards Enhanced UAV Capabilities – The Multi-rotor Air-Crane","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Anderson","KC Wong","and Patrick Hendrick"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1488067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488067200,"objectID":"3975833ae7482ce04c044b680c4c5bcb","permalink":"https://andersonrayner.github.io/publication/2017_propellers/","publishdate":"2017-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_propellers/","section":"publication","summary":"Propeller dynamics play an important role in the stability and controllability of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), however are often greatly simplified or even neglected altogether when designing multirotor simulations.  This paper presents a method for calculating and simulating the dynamics of a brushless motor and propeller typical of the size used in small multirotors so that the rotation speed and generated forces may be accurately reconstructed from an input pulse width modulation (PWM) signal.\nThe system model is identified using a series of sine-sweep inputs. Results show that the force and torque generated by the propeller and the power required can be accurately modelled from a raw input PWM signal, even for the dynamic case where the propeller is changing speed.

Tools such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used to optimise the shape of UAV frames by giving a detailed understanding of how the flow interacts with the vehicle. The effects of the frame on the propellers (and vice versa) can be a dominant flow feature, especially for multirotors, however fully modelling propellers in CFD is a very involved task requiring intensive computational power.\nActuator and blade element disks provide a simple way of modelling the effects of a propeller in CFD by artificially applying a force into the domain, emulating the time-averaged effect of the propeller to reduce the computational requirements.\nThis paper presents an actuator disk model with three different loading profiles and a blade element disk model with two methods of calculating the thrust and the torque of the propeller. These models are implemented in FINE/Open using OpenLabs. The effect of using the differing models is shown, with results matching well with other implementations presented in literature.","tags":[],"title":"Modelling Propellers in FINE/Open using OpenLabs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Anderson","Kai Lehmkuehler","Derrick Ho","KC Wong","Patrick Hendrick"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1379376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1379376e3,"objectID":"fbfae3de84997e79390e3d36e83d0697","permalink":"https://andersonrayner.github.io/publication/2013_annularwingdesign/","publishdate":"2013-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013_annularwingdesign/","section":"publication","summary":"Most research today into the aerodynamics of ducts seeks to increase the thrust or efficiency of a propeller nested inside. This study takes a diﬀerent approach to duct design and instead examines the use of a duct as an annular wing with the primary function of generating lift for high speed, cruising flight. The variables of investigation for this research are the location of the propeller inside the annular wing and how the thrust generated by the propeller effects the performance of the wing at various angles of attack. This investigation utilises wind tunnel testing to measure the forces generated by the wing and computational fluid dynamics to study the nature of the flow. The results show little difference aerodynamically between fore and aft mounting locations for the propeller in non-stalled flight, however, a forward mounted propeller is shown to be preferable when the flight envelope also includes the stalled regime. In hover, the aft propeller is shown to be favourable.","tags":[],"title":"Propeller Location Optimisation for Annular Wing Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://andersonrayner.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
